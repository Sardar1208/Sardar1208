### About me
Hey! I am a Software Engineer specializing in React Native. I have around 2+ years of experience in React Native along with Flutter and React JS. During these years I have worked on tech involved in Fintech, Transactions, Networking and social media applications. 

Apart from this, I also have interest in low level languages like Rust. And I like to write blogs and publish youtube videos showcasing my work. (@theOrdinaryDev)
